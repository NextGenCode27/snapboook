# snapboook

Snapboook is social app with minimal UI.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

We used bloc clean architecture in this project.
We are not foccussing on ui thats why we are using very minimal ui design.
Basically we are trying to create this app very smooth with flutter bloc state management.



A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)
